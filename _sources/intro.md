# **Online Book Guide**

Welcome! This guide will walk you through the instructions & features of our online book.

#### Getting Started

The online book is designed to be an interactive learning experience. You can not only read the content but also execute and modify the embedded code examples directly in your browser.

#### Running Codes

* **Locate the Rocket Icon üöÄ:** On the top right of the pages with code, you will find a rocket icon. Hovering over it will reveal a "Live Code" button.
  
  **or**
  
* **Launch in Colab:**  Clicking the (Open in Colab) button at the top of any code page will launch it as a Jupyter notebook in Google Colaboratory, allowing you to run the code in an interactive, live environment.
  
#### Interacting with the Code

* **Execute Code Cells:** Once the (Live Code) button is clicked, you can run each code block (or "cell") by clicking the "run" button below it or by selecting the cell and pressing `Shift + Enter`.
* **Modify and Re-run:** The real power of this interactive environment is the ability to edit the code. You can click into any code cell, make your changes, and then re-run it to see how your modifications affect the output. This is a great way to experiment and deepen your understanding.
* **See Updated Solutions:** After re-running a cell, the output below it will update to reflect the new solution based on your changes.

***Note**: When you run the first code cell, it connects to a virtual machine and sets up the environment (e.g., installs required libraries). This initial setup may take a minute, so a brief wait is expected. Subsequent runs will be significantly faster.*

#### Exploring Other Features

* **Full Screen Mode:** For a more immersive reading experience, you can use the full-screen button, typically located at the top right of the page.
* **Download Notebooks:** You can download the notebook files (.ipynb) to run them locally using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. Just look for the ‚¨áÔ∏è icon at the top right of the desired section and select the appropriate format.

We encourage you to actively engage with the material by running, editing, and experimenting with the code. Happy exploring!
