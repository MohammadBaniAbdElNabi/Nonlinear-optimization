# Unconstrained Optimization

The simplest unconstrained optimization problem occurs when the objective function $f$ involves just a single variable, is differentiable, and is concave for a maximization problem or convex for a minimization problem. In that case, the equation $df/dx = 0$ can be solved analytically to obtain the optimum value $x*$ because the necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality are met. If, however, this equation cannot be solved easily, it may be reasonable to resort to an iterative search procedure.Because there is only one variable, a one-dimensional search suffices.
