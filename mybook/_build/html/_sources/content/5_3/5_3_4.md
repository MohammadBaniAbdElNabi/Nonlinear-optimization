#  **More Advanced Methods**

Quadratic programming models represent one special case of nonlinear programming problems, but there are many additional methods that have been developed for solving various other special types of nonlinear problems. **Gradient methods** are based on the ideas presented previously in **Section 5.2.2**, but must include special provisions to restrict the search within the feasible region. One of the best-known of these is the **reduced gradient method** (Wolfe 1967, Lasdon and Warren 1978, Murtagh and Saunders 1978). In particular, the Lasdon and Waren algorithm, GRG2 (Generalized Reduced Gradient) is available in standard spreadsheet packages using the Solver tool. It is based on a Simplex scheme, but instead of improving a current solution by a change of *one* non-basic variable at a time, the reduced gradient method simultaneously changes as many non-basic variables as can change and yield an improvement, but at different rates, proportional to their respective partial derivatives. <br>
Unconstrained optimization techniques have also been adapted for **constrained optimization** by the imposition of *penalty functions* or *barrier functions* (Bazaraa et al. 2013).
