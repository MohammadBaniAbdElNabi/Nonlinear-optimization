#  Constrained Optimization

General nonlinear objective functions with general nonlinear constraints are the subject of this section. The methods to be applied will differ, depending on the nature of the constraints. Equality constraints can be dealt with using the method of Lagrange multipliers. Inequality constraints require the more comprehensive Karush–Kuhn–Tucker theory, which is central to the entire subject of mathematical programming. We will conclude with a short discussion of some popularly used techniques.
